## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Command Management** | Store, tag, search, alias, and run commands instantly |
| **Workflow Engine** | Conditional, capturing, retrying, parallel multi-step workflows (`--flow`) |
| **Secrets** | `{NAME}` resolved from `pass`/`cmd`/`env`/`age`/`file` at run time, kept out of history |
| **Lint** | `--lint` validates stores, packs, and workflows |
| **Reports** | Markdown / CSV / HTML / PDF engagement reports |
| **Git Sync** | Version/share the data dir (`--sync`) |
| **Parameterized Commands** | `nmap {TARGET} -sV`; `{VAR:=default}` and `{VAR:?}` (required) forms |
| **Host/Target Model** | Inventory hosts; `@name` / `--on` / `--all-hosts` fill `{TARGET}` etc. |
| **Output Capture → Chaining** | `--capture VAR[:regex]` pipes a command's stdout into an env var |
| **Remote Execution** | `--on <host>` runs a stored command over SSH |
| **Findings & Reporting** | Structured findings + markdown engagement report (`--report`) |
| **Run History** | Recorded runs; `--history`; re-run with `-r last` |
| **Encrypted Workspaces** | Lock a workspace to an encrypted blob at rest (age/gpg) |
| **Danger Flag** | `--danger` commands always confirm before running, even with `-y` |
| **Fuzzy Picker** | `--pick` (or bare `cmdr`) fuzzy-find a command via fzf, with a live preview pane (`ctrl-n` dry-run, `ctrl-y` copy) |
| **JSON Output** | `--json` on read commands (`-s`/`-f`/`--history`/`--findings`/`--host list`/`-W`/`--pack list`) for scripting |
| **External Import** | `--import history\|tldr\|cheat\|file` pulls commands from shell history, tldr, cheat.sh, or a file (preview-first) |
| **Fast Search** | Optional SQLite search index for large stores (`CMDR_INDEX=1`); JSON stays source of truth |
| **Interactive Menu** | `-I` / `--menu` — optional tick-menu: checkbox-select commands/packs (fzf multi-select, bash fallback) |
| **Workspaces** | Isolated command stores per engagement or project |
| **Environment Variables** | Set `TARGET=10.10.10.1` once, use `{TARGET}` everywhere |
| **Playbooks** | Chain commands into named, reusable sequences |
| **Output Capture** | Save command output with timestamps (`--save`) |
| **Command Packs** | Pre-built command sets for CTF and development |
| **Project-Local Commands** | `.cmdr.json` per repository with `--local` (trust-gated) |
| **Notes** | Attach timestamped notes to commands |
| **Clipboard Copy** | Copy resolved commands to clipboard (`-c`) |
| **Tab Completion** | Bash and Zsh support |
| **Dry-Run / Undo** | Preview (`-n`) and single-level undo (`-u`) |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SP1R4/CMDR.git
cd CMDR
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Install `jq` if missing (supports apt, dnf, yum, pacman, brew)
- Set file permissions
- Offer alias or `~/.local/bin` symlink install
- Enable tab completion

After install:
```bash
cmdr -h
```

**Platforms:** Linux and macOS. The only hard dependencies are `bash` and `jq`;
CMDR runs on the stock macOS `/bin/bash` (3.2) and avoids GNU-only tool flags, so
the same scripts work under both BSD and GNU userland. Optional features degrade
gracefully when their tool is absent (`age`/`gpg` for encryption, `fzf` for the
picker, `pandoc` for HTML/PDF reports, `timeout`/`gtimeout` for workflow timeouts,
`pbcopy`/`xclip`/`xsel`/`wl-copy` for clipboard). CI runs the full suite on both
Ubuntu and macOS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add a command
cmdr -a serve 'python3 -m http.server 8080' dev --desc 'Quick HTTP server'

# Add with alias
cmdr -a scan 'nmap {TARGET} -sV' security --desc 'Service scan' --alias s

# Set an env variable
cmdr --env TARGET=10.10.10.1

# Run it (TARGET auto-fills from env)
cmdr -r scan

# Or pass args directly
cmdr -r scan 192.168.1.1

# Dry-run to preview
cmdr -n -r scan

# Copy to clipboard instead of running
cmdr -c scan

# Show all commands
cmdr -s

# Search
cmdr -f nmap
```

> **Tip:** prefer ticking over typing? Run `cmdr -I` (or `--menu`) for an
> interactive, arrow-key menu — select commands to run, load packs, set env
> vars, and switch workspaces. See [Interactive Menu](#interactive-menu).

## CTF Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace for the engagement
cmdr -w htb-box

# 2. Load CTF command packs
cmdr --pack load ctf-network
cmdr --pack load ctf-web
cmdr --pack load ctf-privesc

# 3. Inventory targets (fills {TARGET}/{OS}/{RUSER}/{RPORT})
cmdr --host add 10.10.10.50 --name box1 --os linux
cmdr --host add 10.10.10.51 --name box2 --os windows --user administrator
cmdr --env LPORT=4444

# 4. Recon against a host
cmdr -r quick-scan @box1 --save
cmdr -r dirfuzz @box1 --save

# 5. Chain an auth flow: capture a token, reuse it downstream
cmdr -r login @box1 --capture 'TOKEN:eyJ[A-Za-z0-9._-]+'
cmdr -r list-users @box1            # uses {TOKEN}

# 6. Record structured findings (feed the report later)
cmdr --finding high box1 "Unauth API at /admin" --evidence outputs/dirfuzz_*.log
cmdr --finding medium box1 "Tomcat 9.0 — CVE candidate"

# 7. Reusable recon playbook, then fan across every host
cmdr --playbook recon quick-scan dirfuzz nikto-scan
cmdr -r quick-scan --all-hosts --save

# 8. Run privesc remotely once you have creds
cmdr -r linpeas --on box2

# 9. Review and produce the deliverable
cmdr --findings
cmdr --history
cmdr --report engagement.md

# 10. Lock the engagement workspace at rest, switch back to default
cmdr --lock-workspace htb-box
cmdr -w default
```

## Dev Workflow

```bash
# 1. Load dev packs globally (in default workspace)
cmdr --pack load dev-python
cmdr --pack load dev-docker
cmdr --pack load dev-git

# 2. Add project-local commands
cmdr --local -a build 'make -j$(nproc)' dev --desc 'Build project'
cmdr --local -a test 'python3 -m pytest -v tests/' dev --desc 'Run tests'
cmdr --local -a lint 'flake8 . && mypy .' dev --desc 'Lint check'

# 3. Create a CI-like chain
cmdr --playbook ci lint test build

# 4. Run it
cmdr -p ci

# 5. Quick git workflow
cmdr -r glog              # Pretty git log
cmdr -r git-branch-clean  # Clean merged branches
```

## Workspaces

Workspaces isolate commands, env vars, notes, playbooks, and outputs.

```bash
cmdr -w myproject       # Switch to workspace
cmdr -w                 # Show active workspace
cmdr -W                 # List all workspaces
cmdr -w default         # Return to default workspace
```

## Environment Variables

Per-workspace variables that auto-substitute `{KEY}` placeholders at runtime.

```bash
cmdr --env TARGET=10.10.10.1   # Set
cmdr --env PORT=8080           # Set another
cmdr --env                     # Show all
cmdr --env-clear PORT          # Remove one
```

Resolution order: env vars are substituted first, then remaining `{placeholders}` are filled from positional arguments or prompted interactively.

## Playbooks & Chains

```bash
# Create a named playbook
cmdr --playbook recon quick-scan dirfuzz nikto-scan

# Run it
cmdr -p recon

# List all playbooks
cmdr --playbooks

# One-off chain (no save)
cmdr --chain cmd1 cmd2 cmd3

# Dry-run a playbook
cmdr -n -p recon
```

Playbooks and chains stop on first failure (non-zero exit).

## Command Packs

Pre-built command sets in the `packs/` directory.

```bash
cmdr --pack list              # See available packs
cmdr --pack load ctf-web      # Load a pack
```

| Pack | Commands | Category |
|------|----------|----------|
| `starter` | handy sysadmin/network/dev/security one-liners | mixed |
| `ctf-toolkit` | full companion set for [ctf-toolkit-setup](https://github.com/SP1R4/ctf-toolkit-setup) (ffuf, nuclei, httpx, feroxbuster, gdb/GEF, radare2, pwntools, john, hashcat, hydra, hashcracker, steghide, stegseek, zsteg, vol3, RsaCtfTool, [BackupHandler](https://github.com/SP1R4/BackupHandler), …) | tk-recon, tk-web, tk-pwn, tk-crypto, tk-forensics, tk-crack, tk-shell, tk-backup |
| `ctf-network` | nmap scans, enum4linux, netcat, DNS | ctf-recon, ctf-enum, ctf-exploit |
| `ctf-web` | ffuf, gobuster, sqlmap, nikto, wfuzz | ctf-web |

> The `pentest-*` packs are for **authorized** engagements (CTF, labs, pentests
> with written permission). Intrusive commands that can lock accounts, poison a
> network, or get a remote shell (password spray, Responder, ntlmrelayx, psexec,
> mass-scan, DB dump) are flagged `[!]` and always prompt before running — even
> with `-y`. Most reference tools the `ctf-toolkit-setup` installer doesn't
> include yet; install them yourself or see the issue tracker.

### Pairing with ctf-toolkit-setup

[ctf-toolkit-setup](https://github.com/SP1R4/ctf-toolkit-setup) provisions a CTF
box (Ubuntu/Debian) with a broad toolset — and installs CMDR as part of the run.
Its installer also seeds the matching `ctf-toolkit` pack automatically, so every
command lines up with an actually-installed binary:

```bash
# On a freshly provisioned box (toolkit does this for you):
cmdr --pack load ctf-toolkit
cmdr -s tk-          # browse the toolkit commands (tk-* tags)
```

Wordlist paths default to the toolkit's Ubuntu layout
(`/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/`, `/usr/share/seclists/`, `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`).
Override per environment (e.g. Kali) without editing the pack:

```bash
cmdr --env WORDLIST=/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
cmdr --env ROCKYOU=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## Notes & Output Capture

```bash
# Attach a finding to a command
cmdr --note scan "Found port 8080, Apache Tomcat 9.0"

# View notes
cmdr --notes scan     # For one command
cmdr --notes          # All notes

# Save command output
cmdr -r scan --save

# View saved outputs
cmdr --outputs        # All
cmdr --outputs scan   # Filtered
```

## Project-Local Commands

Place a `.cmdr.json` in any directory. CMDR merges it with your global/workspace commands so its tags are usable from that directory. Local entries take precedence (a deep merge: fields you omit locally fall back to the global entry of the same tag).

```bash
# Add to the local file
cmdr --local -a build 'make -j4' dev

# Shows under "Project-Local" section
cmdr -s

# Run normally (resolved from local first)
cmdr -r build
```

### Trust model (important)

A `.cmdr.json` contains shell commands that CMDR will execute. To avoid running
commands from a directory you just `cd`'d into (e.g. a freshly cloned, untrusted
repo), **local files are ignored until you explicitly trust them**:

```bash
cmdr --trust      # approve the current dir's .cmdr.json after reviewing it
cmdr --untrust    # revoke trust
```

- Authoring a local file with `cmdr --local -a ...` trusts it automatically.
- Trust is pinned to the file's **content hash** — if the file changes, trust is
  revoked until you re-run `cmdr --trust`. Review the diff before re-trusting.
- Trust is recorded globally in `.cmdr_trusted.json`, keyed by absolute path.

> Note: stored commands run via `bash -c`, so values from env vars and arguments
> are shell-interpreted. Only trust local files (and run commands) you've read.

## Hosts & Targeting

Build a per-workspace host inventory, then target commands at hosts. Selecting a
host fills `{TARGET}`/`{RHOST}` (ip or hostname), `{RHOSTNAME}`, `{OS}`,
`{RUSER}`, `{RPORT}`.

```bash
cmdr --host add 10.10.10.5 --name dc01 --os windows --user admin --port 5985
cmdr --host list
cmdr --host rm dc01

cmdr -r smbscan @dc01           # fill host vars for one host
cmdr -r nmap --all-hosts        # run once per defined host
cmdr -r linpeas --on dc01       # execute over SSH (uses user/port from the host)
```

### /etc/hosts sync

`--hostname` may carry several space-separated names (the first is canonical for
`{RHOSTNAME}` and SSH). `cmdr --host sync-etc` mirrors every host that has a
`--hostname` into a managed, per-workspace block in `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
cmdr --host add 10.129.51.189 --name snapped \
     --hostname 'snapped.htb admin.snapped.htb' --etc   # add + write /etc/hosts
cmdr --host sync-etc                                     # re-push the whole workspace
cmdr --host sync-etc --clear                             # remove this workspace's block
```

```text
# >>> cmdr:htb-box >>>
# managed by 'cmdr --host sync-etc' — lines between the markers are overwritten
10.129.51.189   snapped.htb admin.snapped.htb
# <<< cmdr:htb-box <<<
```

The block is rewritten on every sync (no duplicates), lines outside it are left
intact, and `sudo` is used only when `/etc/hosts` is not already writable *and*
the content changed. A one-time `/etc/hosts.cmdr.bak` is kept, the macOS DNS
cache is flushed after a change, and any hand-added entry for a managed name is
reported and left alone. Set `$CMDR_ETC_HOSTS` to target a different file.

For the classic muscle-memory flow, source `contrib/addhost.sh` (bash or zsh) —
`install.sh` offers to wire it into your shell rc, or add it by hand:

```bash
. /path/to/CMDR/contrib/addhost.sh
addhost $IP snapped.htb admin.snapped.htb    # -> cmdr --host add ... --etc
synchosts                                    # -> cmdr --host sync-etc
delhost snapped                              # -> cmdr --host rm snapped
```

If `cmdr` is not on your `PATH` (alias installs), set `CMDR_BIN=/path/to/cmdr.sh`
before sourcing.

## Output Capture → Chaining

Pipe a command's stdout into a workspace env var, then use it in the next command —
ideal for tokens, session ids, and multi-step exploitation.

```bash
cmdr -r login --capture TOKEN                 # whole (trimmed) stdout -> {TOKEN}
cmdr -r login --capture 'TOKEN:eyJ[A-Za-z0-9._-]+'   # first regex match -> {TOKEN}
cmdr -r get-users                             # command references {TOKEN}
```

## Placeholder Forms

```text
{VAR}            env var, else next positional arg, else interactive prompt
{VAR:=default}   env var, else next positional arg, else 'default' (no prompt)
{VAR:?}          env var, else next positional arg, else hard error (required)
```

## Findings & Reporting

```bash
cmdr --finding high dc01 "Unauth WinRM" --evidence outputs/winrm_x.log
cmdr --finding low - "Verbose banner"      # '-' = no specific host
cmdr --findings                            # list, ordered by severity
cmdr --report engagement.md                # markdown report (hosts/findings/notes/history)
```

## Run History

```bash
cmdr --history          # recent runs (exit codes, host, command)
cmdr --history 50       # last 50
cmdr -r last            # re-run the most recent command (alias: cmdr -r !)
```

## Dangerous Commands

Mark destructive commands so they always prompt for confirmation — even under `-y`
or inside playbooks. They show a red `[!]` in `cmdr -s`.

```bash
cmdr -a wipe 'rm -rf {DIR}' ops --danger
cmdr -r wipe /data        # prompts "Run this command marked dangerous? (y/N)"
```

## Encrypted Workspaces

Encrypt a named workspace to a single blob at rest (uses `age`, falls back to
`gpg`). The plaintext directory is removed on lock and restored on unlock.

```bash
cmdr -w client-x                 # work in a named workspace
cmdr --lock-workspace client-x   # -> workspaces/client-x.cmdrlock, prompts passphrase
cmdr --unlock-workspace client-x # decrypt and restore
```

## Fuzzy Picker

```bash
cmdr --pick      # fuzzy-find a command with fzf and run it
cmdr             # bare invocation on a TTY also opens the picker (falls back to -m)
```

## Interactive Menu

An optional, tick-based menu — for when you'd rather select than type flags. The
normal CLI is unchanged; this is just another way in.

```bash
cmdr -I          # or --menu / --interactive
```

A top-level hub lets you:

- **Run commands** — tick one or more, then run / dry-run / copy; placeholders
  are prompted as usual.
- **Load packs** — tick which packs to import.
- **Set an env var** or **switch workspace**.

Navigate with the **arrow keys** (or vim `j`/`k`): **↑/↓** move, **SPACE** ticks,
**a** ticks all, **ENTER** confirms, **q** cancels. Uses `fzf` (with fuzzy filter)
when it's installed, otherwise a zero-dependency bash TUI with a scrolling
viewport for long lists. Needs a terminal (exits cleanly if there isn't one).

## Workflows

Workflows are JSON files describing conditional, multi-step runs — the step up
from linear playbooks. Each step runs a stored command and can capture output,
gate on a condition, retry, time out, run remotely, or run a `parallel` block.

```json
{
  "name": "recon",
  "steps": [
    { "run": "quick-scan", "args": ["@dc01"], "register": "scan",
      "capture": { "OPEN_PORTS": "[0-9]+(?:,[0-9]+)*" } },
    { "run": "smb-enum",  "when": "env:OPEN_PORTS contains 445" },
    { "run": "exploit",   "when": "step:scan.exit == 0", "retry": 2, "timeout": 60,
      "continue_on_error": true },
    { "parallel": [ { "run": "dirfuzz" }, { "run": "nikto" } ] }
  ]
}
```

```bash
cmdr --flow import recon.json     # store it by name
cmdr --flow run recon             # run stored, or: cmdr --flow run ./recon.json
cmdr -n --flow run recon          # dry-run: show the steps and which would skip
cmdr --flow list                  # list stored workflows
```

**Step fields:** `run`, `args` (incl. `@host`), `when`, `capture` (`{VAR:"regex"}`,
empty regex = whole output), `register` (id for conditions), `retry`, `timeout`
(needs `timeout`/`gtimeout`), `remote: true` (SSH via the step's `@host`),
`continue_on_error`. A `{ "parallel": [ ... ] }` block runs its substeps
concurrently.

**Conditions (`when`)** — a small, shell-injection-safe DSL:
`env:NAME`, `step:ID.exit`, `step:ID.stdout`, or a bare `NAME` (= env) on the
left; operators `==`, `!=`, `contains`, `matches` (regex), or `NAME exists`;
join clauses with `&&` or `||`; negate a clause with a leading `!`.

## Secrets

Map a `{NAME}` placeholder to a secret source. The value is fetched **only at
execution time**, so it never lands in the stored command, the run history, the
logs, or the on-screen "Running" line — those keep the `{NAME}` token.

```bash
cmdr --secret DBPASS pass:work/db          # from `pass`
cmdr --secret TOKEN  cmd:'vault read -field=t secret/x'
cmdr --secret KEY    env:MY_ENV_VAR        # from the environment
cmdr --secret PW     age:~/.secrets/pw.age # age-encrypted file
cmdr --secrets                             # list (sources only, never values)
cmdr -a dbq 'psql "host={TARGET} password={DBPASS}"' db
cmdr -r dbq @prod                          # {DBPASS} filled only for the child process
```

Providers: `pass` · `cmd` · `env` · `age` · `file`. `cmdr -c` (clipboard) *does*
resolve secrets, since copied commands are meant to be pasted and run.

## Lint

```bash
cmdr --lint     # validate command stores, packs, and workflows
```
Flags invalid JSON, empty commands, bad tag names, unbalanced `{ }` placeholders,
and workflow steps that reference unknown commands. Exits non-zero on problems —
handy in CI or a pre-commit hook.

## Reports

```bash
cmdr --report engagement.md      # markdown (default)
cmdr --report findings.csv       # CSV of findings
cmdr --report report.html        # HTML (needs pandoc)
cmdr --report report.pdf         # PDF (needs pandoc + a LaTeX engine)
cmdr --report out.txt --format csv
```
Format is inferred from the extension, or forced with `--format md|csv|html|pdf`.

## Sync

Version and share the data dir (commands, hosts, findings, workflows, …) via git:

```bash
cmdr --sync-remote git@github.com:you/engagements.git
cmdr --sync "after box1 recon"
```
Sync refuses to run when the data dir is the CMDR install directory — point
`CMDR_DATA_DIR` at a separate folder first.

## Development & Testing

CMDR is plain Bash + `jq`, no build step. Lint and test before sending changes:

```bash
shellcheck -x -S warning cmdr.sh cmdr_functions.sh install.sh tests/run.sh
bash tests/run.sh
```

CI runs both on every push. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines
and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.
